# Design Patterns in Go

This comprehensive course offers a detailed exploration of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, initially presented in their influential book. It encompasses contemporary adaptations, refinements, and in-depth discussions on the inherent application of patterns within the language. Design patterns serve as replicable resolutions for prevalent programming challenges and gained widespread recognition following the release of the seminal 1994 book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm, collectively known as the Gang of Four (GoF).
